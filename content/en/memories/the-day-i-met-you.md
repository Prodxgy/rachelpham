It's crazy that 1 year ago, I was truly hopeless. I had friends, but I wanted to have someone to be able to go to at anytime. I wanted a lifelong bond and truly be loved. You made that happen. Rachel Chau Pham, you are truly the love of my life and no matter what we go through, I will try my best to support you through it. I want to be with you foreveer, and there's no doubt in my mind about seeing this relationship becoming stronger as the years progress. **I love you forever.**

To this day, I would never think I would ever get that close to you touching wise on the first time that we met.

I remember this was the first time you wore your new **Air Fawk Mop's** and it was slushy ðŸ¥².
