I'm not sure to say if I really screwed up on this anniversary or did well because every anniversary after I feel like I did nothing. But what I did show (or atleast I hoped I did) was show love. Maybe it could've been better, but I really enjoyed this night with you.

Looking back on this, my style has changed so much and so much for the better. Thanks Rachel for fixing this part of me that I've been very insecure and unknowledgable about. You'll always be the person that I'll go to for my fit checks.

Not sure if this was even apart of this night but I just thought you looked super stunning so I had to include it hehe.
