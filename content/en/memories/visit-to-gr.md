Yikes, where do I start. This trip really showed me the otherside of Michigan. I've never really touched the East side except for Holland or driving through it to get to Chicago. But from what I can tell you, its just as beautiful of a place to live in like the West side (besides the fact you guys don't have Dave's Hot Chicken, but I guess Tony can substitute). But like Mark said, Grand Rapids is a beautiful place to live in. In the trip side of things, we didn't really plan well and that showed up clearly in Emma, Joanna, and Chloe's faces. You were able to get closer to me (and Sampath & Prathik) though!

We got some really cute pics here. We for real need to do a photoshoot together, maybe Sampath & Sophia as a photographer ðŸ‘€.
