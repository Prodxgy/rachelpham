You really might not have known this, but I was deathly afraid to go with you for Lunar New Years. This was really the first one-on-one interactions I've had with your parents. I was anticipating majority of what Hollywood stereotypes have been put into my head like your Dad telling me to "get lost" or something along those lines. But instead I was just greeted with your family's love. I still to this day struggle to tell when your Dad is tricking me into doing stuff, but I'm just his little foreign boy to be toyed around with. I think either way, your parents are great. I believe this is when I met your grandparents as well, but we know how that turned out for me ðŸ˜”.
