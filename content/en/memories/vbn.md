~~sorry for the shameless pass plug but halo-halo will be better~~

This is the first event where I wore formal attire with you! I thought I looked alright, but you looked stunning to me! Even though you don't go to VSA events anymore, I think you should come to the PASS one's at least. Personally, I find them more fun and interactive than VSA one's (they hurt me last time ðŸ˜­). Plus a lot of the board wants to meet you and it wouldn't hurt to be more friends with Filipinos ~~so I can colonize you~~ to make you more culturally aware! At least come to the GBM that I organized ðŸ˜•.

Maybe next time I should wear more, like a vest and tie ðŸ‘€.
