Truly breathtaking, just like the scene in Tangled. I'm really fortunate to spend it with someone I love the most. It really makes me wanna go there again or even better, go stargazing with you up north. Well maybe not all the way up north, but somewhere deep where light pollution won't affect our viewing experience. Just imagine it during a meteor shower, us cuddling in the dark as we watch the meteors paint the sky.
